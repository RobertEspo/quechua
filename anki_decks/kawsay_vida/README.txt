These .csv files were created based on the Kawsay Vida textbook, which teaches primarily Bolivian Quechua. You can easily import these files into Anki to create decks. Some of the sentences are taken directly from the textbook's roleplay exercises, but the majority of the sentences are created by myself, an L2 Quechua speaker, using only the information provided in the book. If you encounter a mistake, please contact me at robertesposito574@gmail.com.

Chapters that have a lot of vocabulary or grammar points are divided into multiple decks, indicated by a suffix -A, -B, -C, etc.

Not all vocabulary taught in the book is documented in these decks. For example, there are a lot of Andes-specific food and clothing that is taught in the book, which is not currently taught in this deck. In the future, I may add decks for those specific cultural items with pictures. The reason for this is (1) cultural items are difficult to teach, (2) they have little use outside of the Andes, and (3) the decks would double or triple in size, which would make learning much more difficult.

The document GRAMMAR.rmd documents the grammar points and general communication goals taught in each chapter/file.

FUTURE GOALS:
>Add decks with cultural items (food, clothes, architecture, etc.)
>Export Anki files so that you can just download the decks themselves
>Add pictures to all decks
>Add audio from native speakers
